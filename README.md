# xtpublic
This repository is for my previous clients which I provied consulting services.
It was hosted on bitbucket before 2021. Since the system is pretty stable, I will
update compiled library quarterly.

At the mean time, only python part is made public. I will make some of the
c++ source codes public later.

Note that sources of some third party libraries are embedded in xtcommon, 
you don't need to link to their so or dlls.

#embedded third party libraries:
*google protobuf2

*zeromq

*json-spirit

*talib

*quantlib(only a small part of it)
# xtal tech's own library is used for option pricing, quantlib is used to fitting curves)

*mongo-c-driver

*sqlite

*curl-7.58
